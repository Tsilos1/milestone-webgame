            <p>The earth signs are grounded and sensible. They are the most sensible and stable of the signs They prefer to create a plan and implement it one step at a time. They prefer having a routine or pattern to stick to, and will get upset if that routine is broken or interrupted. They are stubborn and stick to their guns when it comes to their ideals, and are rigid in their ways. <br><br>

            On the downside, earth signs feel like life is stagnant. Further, due to being so grounded, they can lose sight of the spiritual or emotional sides of life.  
            </p>
        </div>
            
        <div id="air" style="display:none" >
            <h1>You are air</h1>
            <img src="assets/air.jpg" alt="image of air" style="height:300px" class="resultsImage">
            <h5 class="center">Photo by Darius Krause: https://www.pexels.com/photo/white-clouds-under-blue-sky-2931915/</h5><br><br>
            <p>The air signs are intellectual people and enjoy learning about things. They have excellent communication skills. They are social butterflies and enjoy talking about whatever happens to be on their mind. Air signs are restless and often on the go. Rational and logical, they think things through and can be great decision makers. Air signs are adventurous and not afraid take risks. This sometimes gets them in trouble, but alternatively can lead to accomplishing great things. <br><br>

            On the downside, because they take the time to think things through and can’t come up with an immediate answer, they can be seen as indecisive. Additionally, they can feel detached and are often disconnected from their emotional side. Being less grounded, they can seem spacey and unreliable.

        <div id="water" style="display:none">
            <h1>You are water</h1>
            <img src="assets/water.jpg" alt="image of water" style="height:300px" class="resultsImage">
            <h5 class="center">Photo by Pixabay: https://www.pexels.com/photo/body-of-water-261403/</h5><br><br>
            <p>Water people are super intuitive and often make decisions based on their intuition, which is usually spot on. They are empathetic  and can empathize with others’ situations.They are the most nurturing of all the signs. Water signs are creative and artistic by nature. They are often seen as mysterious because of their guarded personalities. Water signs are highly observant and like to sit back and watch. Things may seem intense, especially when it comes to the water signs’ emotions. 

            On the downside, water signs get hurt easily due to their sensitive natures. To others, they can come across as too emotional, and therefore, irrational. Because they are more observant, they can come across as aloof.

        <div id="fire" style="display:none">
            <h1>You are Fire</h1>

            <h5 class="center">Photo by Adonyi Gábor: https://www.pexels.com/photo/red-and-orange-fire-1558916/</h5><br><br>
                <p>The fire signs are just like they sound, full of fire and passion. They are the sign that takes action instead of just thinking about their ideas and passions. They are natural leaders and strive to inspire and motivate others. They are super expressive about their thoughts and ideas, not caring much about what other people may think or believe. Fire signs are courageous and will face their issues head-on. They are outgoing people who are bold. They are dominant and are not afraid to strike up a conversation. They are often the life of the party. Fire signs are competitive and like to win whatever it is they may be competing for. <br><br>
                
                The downside of the fire signs is that they can be temperamental and impatient. They are sometimes overwhelmed, overconfident, and can be selfish.</p>

            <h6 class="center">Photo by Roman Pohorecki: https://www.pexels.com/photo/close-up-photography-of-bonfire-on-beach-sand-16704/</h6><br><br>
            
            <p>A combination of the elementals, mixed signs are like versatile chameleons.They are sometimes action-takers, but sometimes prefer to take things one step at a time. Sometimes they take time to think things through, and others they base their next steps on their intuition. They can, at times, seem aloof, but at other times are social and communicative. Mixed people can be motivators, and at other times prefer to keep to themselves. Depending on the situation, they may take risks, or they may prefer to quietly observe, then base their actions on their careful calculations. Sometimes they are intellectual, and other times more emotional. Mixed signs can be rigid and prefer routine, but at other times they may be spontaneous.<br><br>

            On the downside, mixed signs can be hard to read because others never know what to expect. Which elemental will they be more like in any given situation? Who knows.
