# milestone-webgame

My webgame is an interactive quiz entitled, "Which element are you?" 

I chose this particular webgame because I enjoy taking fun quizzes like this on Facebook and thought I could make one, too. I am drawn to the metaphysical and astrology, so this idea seemed perfect for me.

The controls are easy enough. Just go to the homepage, read the questions, and check the radio button that applies to the user. Then, click submit to go to the results page. The results page will tell the user what element they are based on their answers. 

I used html, css, bootstrap, and javascript for this project. 

The game has one issue that I'm having trouble addressing, and that's the margins or center style in mobile view. For some reason, the right margin is larger than the left. I tried adjusting the margins and setting the centering style using css and html and nothing that I've tried is working. I've spent a considerable time trying to fix the issue, but have not been able to come up with a solution to this problem. Other than that the quiz is complete and ready to play.
